# README
 
discord.py has changed since the creation of this bot, so it probably wouldn't work anymore. The new additions after the hackathon were also never fully finished, particularly the help commands. The original submission that won my high school's hackathon can be viewed [here](https://devpost.com/software/server-insights) (it was greatly modified since then).
